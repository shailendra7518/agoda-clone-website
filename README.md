# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Agoda (Clone)
In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of Agoda Website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-5 in Masai School, we were able to clone the front end, integrated it with backend and added similar looks and features..

## About Agoda
Agoda is one of the world’s fastest growing online travel booking platforms. From its beginnings as an e-commerce start-up based in Singapore in 2005, Agoda has grown to offer a global network of 2 million properties in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. It provides travelers with easy access to a wide choice of luxury and budget hotels, apartments, homes, and villas to suit all budgets and travel occasions.

Headquartered in Singapore, Agoda is part of Booking Holdings (Nasdaq: BKNG) and employs more than 4,000 staff in more than 30 countries. Agoda.com and the Agoda mobile app are available in 38 languages.

## Pages & Features:

- `Home Page`: Tried best to clone the home page .
- `Sign-Up Page`: User details validated directly from Backend.
- `Sign-In Page`: User authentication to check whether user email and password match with details existing in the backend.
- `Property Gallery`: Gallery created dynamically.
- `Property Description`: Displays the details of property selected by the users.
- `Checkout Page`: Users can add the delivery address.
- `Payment Page`: debit and credit card payment option. Users can add their payment details.

## How To Use ✅

First you have to have to go to the signup page and create a new account. After the signup process is completed you have to login with the same details and then it will redirect you to the landing page. After that users will all the details related to the destination. After that it will redirect you to the property gallery page. If a user will click on the select room it will redirect to the property description page and then after checking the availability of the selected property user will redirect to the checkout page after filling their personal details, it will proceed to the payment page there user can add their debit/credit card details to place the booking.
